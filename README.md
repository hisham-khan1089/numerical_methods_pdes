# Exploration of Numerical Methods for PDEs
(Ongoing)

This repository contains
- My notes from chapter 6 of Haberman's Applied PDEs with Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems
- Simulations of some basic PDEs in Python, along with video files

This project is ongoing, and the files in this will be updated as I continue to do 
more research.

## 

The two key dependencies in this file are:
```bash
numpy
matplotlib
```

These can be installed using pip
