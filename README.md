# Exploration of Numerical Methods for PDEs (ongoing)
This repository contains Python files in which various numerical methods for PDEs have been implemented. The folders are 
organized by type of numerical method, and containing the Python files corresponding to that method used to generate the
simulation files for the given PDE. 

The file called `example_sims` contains mp4s of the simulations that were generated using the Python code.

My main reference from which I learned and implemented the numerical methods in this repository is Chapter 6 of the textbook 
Applied PDEs with Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems by Haberman (4th edition). 

This is an ongoing project, and I will continue to add to this repository as I continue to learn.
